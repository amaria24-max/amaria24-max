# About Me
Hi, I'm mariyah (or amaria24-max) - a physicist working in biotech looking to expand into the tech space.
I'm currently learning Python and have previous experience with MATLAB and Fortann 95. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself 😅.

Out in the real word, I'm on my fitness journey 💪 and *attempting* to learn to sew 😁.

# I'm Interested In:
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- More to come... 👀
